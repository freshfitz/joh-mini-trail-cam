Python script to be used on a raspberry pi. <br />
This script will enable blutooth on a joh mini trail cam <br />
Change the pis wifi to connect to Hunting Cam SSID<br>
Connect to the cams wifi and download the images to the SD card on the pi <br />
Rough first draft of my script but it works <br />
Run: <br />
sudo python3 blue.py <br />
sudo python3 getfile.py <br />
<br />
<br />
This is a rough version of the script but it works I still need to set it to change back to the ISP's wifi
